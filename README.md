# hello-world

Hi everyone, I'm Alex!

I'm an undergraduate student at Loughborough University Studying Sport and Exercise Science.

I'm also an aspiring Sport Performance Analyst and am currently volunteering as a performance analyst with the university performance swimming team. I love all sport, but my main background lies in swimming and athletics. I'm also a huge LFC supporter.

I'm here to connect with people, learn from others and improve my coding ability!
